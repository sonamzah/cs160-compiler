# cs160-compiler
A simple compiler built throughout UCSB's CS160

The code for this project is not made public to uphold academic integrity as github is ripe with copy-able code. 
That said there was much of the project that remained boiler plate.

For potential employer access please contact me and I will add you to the private repo.

Thanks,
Sonam
